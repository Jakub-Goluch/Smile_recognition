# Smile_recognition
CNN which focuses on recognitioning if the face in the image is smiling. Final accuracy is 95%.

After testing model on my own photos I've come to a conclusion that model is scanning image for presence of big white teeth. Without them on the photo model will clasify photo as non_smile. For my own photos in which teeth was visible on smile photos, I've got 100% accuracy.
